#  repated word using hash map
## Whiteboard Process
![Example Image](./assets/repeated words(1).jpg)

## Approach:
so we start by using regex to remove the clutter then we create a hashmap for the words array 
then we use a for loop and get he keys and compare it for each word array instance if they are equal we return the word as athe output
## Efficiency:

O(n) for space 
O(n) for time 



## Solutions 
work to return the value if it encountered it a second time
