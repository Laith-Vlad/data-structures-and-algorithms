## Approach:
### stacks

we use stacks to manipulate the pusedo queue through pop push and peek operations
### pusedo queue
after that i required it in the pusedo queue file and used its operations to manipulate the queue then created tests for it
i created a enqueue and a dequeue 
## Efficiency:

The time and space complexity of queues and stacks can vary depending on the specific implementation and the operations performed. Here's a general overview:

For Stacks:

    Time Complexity:
        Push operation: O(1) - Constant time complexity, as it only involves inserting an element at the top of the stack.
        Pop operation: O(1) - Constant time complexity, as it only involves removing the top element from the stack.
        Peek operation: O(1) - Constant time complexity, as it only involves accessing the top element of the stack.
    Space Complexity:
        The space complexity of a stack depends on the number of elements stored in it. If there are 'n' elements, the space complexity would be O(n) since the stack needs to store each element individually.

For pusdedo Queues:

    Time Complexity:
        Enqueue operation: O(1) - Constant time complexity, as it only involves inserting an element at the rear of the queue.
        Dequeue operation: O(1) - Constant time complexity, as it only involves removing the front element from the queue.
        Peek operation: O(1) - Constant time complexity, as it only involves accessing the front element of the queue.
    Space Complexity:
        The space complexity of a queue also depends on the number of elements stored in it. If there are 'n' elements, the space complexity would be O(n) since the queue needs to store each element individually.
        so it depend on what we are doing 
## Solutions 
it soveles the problem of using a stack to create and delete queues.


***npm test 11test.test.js***

Jest will execute the test cases defined in 11 and provide the test results.
npm test 11test.test.js  will work as expected
