## Approach:


Binary Tree

    Create a Binary Tree class
        Define a method for each of the depth first traversals:
            pre order
            in order
            post order
        Each depth first traversal method should return an array of values, ordered appropriately.

Binary Search Tree

    Create a Binary Search Tree class
        This class should be a sub-class (or your languages equivalent) of the Binary Tree Class, with the following additional methods:
        Add
            Arguments: value
            Return: nothing
            Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
        Contains
            Argument: value
            Returns: boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.



## Efficiency:

the time and space complexcity is O(n) in the worst case scanario
## Solutions
